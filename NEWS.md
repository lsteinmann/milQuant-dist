# milQuant 1.1.0 _2023-11-23_
* Added a button that refreshes the index, so that newly added resources can be seen as well.
* All buttons are now disabled while shiny is busy to avoid unnecessary queries.
* Moved the database query to each tab. Now only the data that is needed in each tab is queried from Field Desktop, hopefully reducing overall loading time and memory usage.
* Redesigned the 'overview'-plot in Plotly. It now displays the complete project database with the exception of 'Type'- and 'Image'-categories.
* Added many tabs for different 'Find'-categories using generalized 'barplot'-module (Plotly).
* Modularized all other tabs. 
* From now on, (almost) all plots are produced in Plotly directly to make better use of Plotlys features.
* Corrected typos, minor text and layout changes
