# milQuant 1.1.0 _2023-11-23_
* Added a button that refreshes the index, so that newly added resources can be seen as well.
* All buttons are now disabled while shiny is busy to avoid unnecessary queries.
* Moved the database query to each tab. Now only the data that is needed in each tab is queried from Field Desktop, hopefully reducing overall loading time and memory usage.
* Redesigned the *overview*-plot in Plotly. It now displays the complete project database with the exception of *Type*- and *Image*-categories.
* Added many tabs for different *Find*-categories using generalized *barplot*-module (Plotly).
* Modularized all other tabs. 
* From now on, (almost) all plots are produced in Plotly directly to make better use of Plotlys features.
* Corrected typos, minor text and made some layout changes.
