# milQuant-dist 2.0.1 _wip_
* Split the Electron-App further from milQuant-R-Package: milQuant (the shiny App) is now only included in this standalone app as one of the installed R-Packages.
* milQuant-Shiny-App can be updated (and users are prompted to do so on a new release) without needing to re-install milQuant-dist. 
* The code is better organized and cleaner. 
* Errors, Warnings and Messages from R are now displayed in the Developer Tools Console.  

### Minor additions:
* An R-Cpnsole can now be opened from the Menubar. 
* There is a rudimentary context menu for copying/pasteing.
